Project: LibraTech: Online Library Management System (OLMS)

Progress Summary:
So far, I have successfully laid the foundational frontend and design architecture for the project. I have moved past the ideation phase and built a working entry point for the application.

Specifically, I have completed:

Project Planning & Strategy: Defined the core objectives and features, ensuring the system includes both traditional library functions (inventory, fines) and modern requirements (digital assets, real-time availability).

UI/UX Design System: Established a modern, clean visual identity (using a Royal Blue and Slate Grey color palette) and planned the user experience for both students and admins.

Frontend Development (Authentication Module): Coded a fully responsive, split-screen Login/Landing page using modern HTML and CSS.

Interactive Logic: Wrote client-side JavaScript to simulate a working login flow. The system currently accepts credentials, validates them, shows a loading state, and successfully redirects the user to a baseline Dashboard.

Project Documentation: Created a comprehensive, formatted README.md file ready for your GitHub repository to professionally showcase your work to faculty and recruiters.
